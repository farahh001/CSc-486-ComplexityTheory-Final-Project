# An analysis of Image Cryptosystem
The goal of the research paper is to encrypt and decrypt images of different sizes using the RSA And AES algorithm. We will analyze the efficiency of encryption 
and decryption. In addition to the efficiency, we will analyze if there is any data lost in the decrypted images i.e if the decrypted gray or color image comes 
out to be exactly as the corresponding original image.
